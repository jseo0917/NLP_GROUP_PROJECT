Dialog summarization is a popular NLP topic. Especially for customer service, agents are often asked to quickly summarize the dialog for the customer at the end of the conversation. The summary should contain the key information including the problem, the solution suggested, and the specific requests from the customer if any. However, in many cases, agents take care of many requests within a short time and are required to provide the summary quickly to minimize the waiting time of the customer. Having the conversation record as input and by building the model structure that can effectively extract the key information from the dialogs, we aim to support the agents in a customer chat service by providing automated summarization in real time.

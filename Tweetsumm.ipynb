To start, can you tell us the software versions your iPhone and Apple Watch are running currently?Customer:@AppleSupport My iPhone is on 11.1.2, and my watch is on 4.1.Agent:@135060 Thank you. Have you tried restarting both devices since this started happening?Customer:@AppleSupport I’ve restarted both, also un-paired then re-paired the watch.Agent:@135060 Got it. When did you first notice that the two devices were not talking to each other. Do the two devices communicate through other apps such as Messages?Customer:@AppleSupport Yes, everything seems fine, it’s just Health and activity.Agent:@135060 Let’s move to DM and look into this a bit more. When reaching out in DM, let us know when this first started happening please. For example, did it start after an update or after installing a certain app? https://t.co/GDrqU22YpT</td>\n",

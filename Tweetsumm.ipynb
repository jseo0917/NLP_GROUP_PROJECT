So we have to turn it up more. This is on all our TVsAgent:@128399 That's odd behavior! Which generation Apple TV do you have? Are you noticing lower volume on all content or a certain show/movie?Customer:@hulu_support Sorry for not replying. It was mostly CBS and other random ones. But seems to be better and back to normal now.Agent:@128399 Apologies for the delay on our end! We're so glad to hear things seem to be back to normal! Let us know if this happens again.Customer:@hulu_support Well it seems like some CBS shows are quieter then other shows/channels. Not sure what happened again.Agent:@128399 Thanks for following up! If you let us know which shows, and which generation Apple TV you have, we'll take a closer look.Customer:@hulu_support 4th gen Apple TV 2 of them. Kevin can wait was one of them and it seems most CBS shows at time can be quieter.Agent:@128399 Is the audio lower all throughout playback or does it decrease at a certain point? Let us know if: https://t.co/56JXI4vxlf helps.Customer:@hulu_support Throughout. It seems random on what shows and when it happens. Almost like it comes and goes. But always CBS shows.   \n",
